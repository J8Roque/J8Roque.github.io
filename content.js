    "Hi, I’m J Roque. I’m building my portfolio to show real hands on IT work, not just class titles. I like troubleshooting because it feels like solving a puzzle, and I care a lot about being clear, calm, and helpful when a user is stressed.",
    "I completed an Associate degree in Information Technology and Cybersecurity at Coastline College, and I’m currently working on my BS in Information Technology at Arizona State University. I’m focused on IT support and systems work, especially the kind of work that builds strong fundamentals like networking, operating systems, security, and clean documentation.",
    "Most of my learning happens through labs and DIY builds. I practice with Windows and Linux, set up virtual machines in Hyper V, and work on projects like Raspberry Pi builds, NAS setup, and small database and SQL work. This site is where I keep everything organized so employers can quickly see what I can actually do."
